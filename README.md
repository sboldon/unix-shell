# unix-shell

This is a group project from my operating systems class. Includes custom ls, wc, and cd commands as well as
the ability to run most unix commands.

Currently it supports one pipe/file write or a combination of the two. Looking to expand its functionality on my own to include 
any number of I/O redirections and a better parsing system that enables a wider set of commands.
